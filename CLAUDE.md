## Project Overview

**omni-notify** monitors livestream platforms (YouTube, Twitch), emails (via Fastmail JMAP), and more — sending Pushover notifications and taking automated actions. Features include live-check notifications, AI briefing agents, parcel tracking from emails, and automatic calendar event creation from emails.

## Quick Reference

```bash
pnpm dev      # Development with hot reload
pnpm build    # TypeScript compilation (run after changes)
pnpm test     # Run tests (vitest)
pnpm check    # Biome linting + formatting check
```

**Always run `pnpm check:write && pnpm test && pnpm build` after making changes.**

Frontend (`frontend/`): React SPA ("Omni Notify") with client-side path routing — `/` dashboard (stat strip, live-streamer cards, task cards with countdowns + run history, activity feed), `/pets` weight tracker (lazy-loaded recharts chunk), `/recommendations` recommendation list with status filters, `/streamers/:id` streamer detail (live status, 7/30/90-day + all-time viewer highs, peak-viewers-by-day bar chart from `ViewerMetricsEntity` daily buckets; streamer cards/pills link here). StreamerPage shares the lazy recharts chunk with PetsPage. All dashboard state flows through one SSE connection (`LiveDataProvider` in `frontend/src/live.tsx`): the server serializes a full snapshot (tasks + streamers + recent runs) once per task-run start/finish and broadcasts it to all connected clients (byte-identical pushes skipped, `X-Accel-Buffering: no` so proxies don't buffer); the client fetches `/api/snapshot` immediately on mount in parallel with opening the stream and polls until the first SSE snapshot lands (first paint never waits on the stream), then falls back to polling whenever the stream is down, showing the connection state in the nav bar. Hashed `/assets/*` are served with immutable cache headers; HTML revalidates. To preview the UI with fake data: `DB_NAME=/tmp/omni-preview.db FRONTEND_PORT=3999 npx tsx src/tools/preview-server.ts`.

### Recommendations Design Invariants

- Taste inputs use ground-truth Plex watch history plus explicit good-pick/not-for-me feedback. Passive outcome labels remain bookkeeping only.
- "Watched" requires ≥80% completion (`WATCHED_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD`); partial starts that stall become "abandoned" (a negative signal for exclusions, not prompts).
- Each recommendation attempt has a unique `recommendationId`; `canonicalId` remains content identity for cooldowns and exclusions.
- The RecommendationEntity row is written as `pending` before acquisition, then flipped to `notified` after Pushover. Stale pending rows are reconciled only when acquisition demonstrably landed or the title was already available in Plex.
- Plex availability, Radarr/Sonarr tracked state, and explicit user feedback are separate concepts. Unavailable service reads abort the run rather than being treated as empty state.
- Cooldown: 180 days for re-recommendation; watched, abandoned, not-for-me, and already-watched titles are excluded permanently unless newer explicit feedback corrects the choice.

### Podcast Recommendations Design Invariants

Deliberately a sibling system to media recommendations (same architecture, separate implementation — the domains differ too much for shared types): episode-level, freshness-critical, and centered on shows the user does NOT already follow.

- Identity: shows are `itunes:{id}` (fallback `feed:{normalized url}`), episodes are `{showId}#{rss guid}` (`types.ts`).
- Release dates are verified from the show's actual RSS feed in code — never trusted from search snippets or model output. Unverifiable candidates are dropped.
- Hard recency window: episodes older than 7 days are ineligible (`filters.ts`).
- Episodes are excluded permanently once delivered; shows get a 30-day cooldown; not-for-me feedback excludes the show permanently unless newer feedback corrects it.
- Subscribed shows are excluded (hard-filtered from the Castro account when configured, prompt-excluded via the seed profile otherwise) and double as the main taste evidence. **The exclusion is load-bearing**: a failed Castro subscription read aborts the run rather than risk recommending a followed show (three-state rule in `subscriptions.ts`).
- Castro is behind the `PodcastAccountClient` bridge (`account.ts`), implemented against its captured private sync protocol (`castro/`, credentials `CASTRO_ACCESS_ID`/`CASTRO_SECRET_KEY`); see `docs/castro-sync.md`. It provides subscriptions, 180 days of listen history, general podcast/episode search, direct RSS resolution, subscription writes, and queue writes. Selected recommendations are resolved by exact RSS URL or iTunes ID and auto-enqueued at Queue Last before notification; resolution or enqueue failure keeps the deep-link fallback. Episode matching against Castro uses the enclosure/media URL, not the RSS guid, which hosting platforms rewrite (see `docs/castro-sync.md`). When unconfigured the pipeline degrades to the seed profile + explicit feedback.
- Commit protocol mirrors media recs: write `pending` before Castro enqueue and Pushover, then flip to `notified`; stale pending rows become failed with a 24h retry exclusion. Enqueue is idempotent, so a retry observes `already_exists` if that effect landed before a crash, while notification delivery remains unverifiable.
- Well-behaved-client controls (Castro is a private, reverse-engineered API): every request funnels through ONE process-wide rate-limit queue in `CastroApi` (concurrency 4, ≤8 req/s) — `createCastroClient` shares a singleton `CastroApi` so overlapping task runs can't double the ceiling; each request is signed at send time. Scheduled tasks jitter ±5min off their cron instant. Listen-history reads (the heaviest fan-out) are skipped entirely when no recommendation is open, and otherwise bounded to just before the oldest open delivery — never the full 180-day window, but always wide enough to cover every open rec (a shorter cutoff would mislabel a listened episode as ignored).
- The old `PodcastPicks` briefing (`briefings/PodcastPicks.md` on the deploy host) is superseded by this feature and should be disabled when `PODCAST_TASTE_PATH` is configured.

## Key Patterns

### Three-State Status System

Providers return one of three statuses to prevent false notifications:

```typescript
enum LiveStatus {
  Live = "live",       // Confirmed live → can trigger "went live" notification
  Offline = "offline", // Confirmed offline → can trigger "went offline" notification
  Unknown = "unknown", // Network error, bad response, etc. → NO state change
}
```

**Why**: Network errors or API changes shouldn't trigger false "offline" notifications mid-stream.

### Adding a New Platform

1. Create `src/live-check/platforms/{platform}.ts` with:
   - `fetch{Platform}LiveStatus({ username })` → `Promise<FetchedStatus>`
   - `get{Platform}LiveUrl(username)` → `string`
   - `extractLiveStatus(data)` → `FetchedStatus` (for testing)

2. Update `src/live-check/platforms/index.ts`:
   - Add to `Platform` enum
   - Add to `platformConfigs` record

3. Update `src/utils/config.ts`:
   - Add `{PLATFORM}_CHANNEL_NAMES: commaSeparatedString`

4. Update `src/index.ts`:
   - Add to the `sources` array passed to `buildStreamers`
   - Add to `PLATFORM_PRIORITY` in `src/live-check/streamers.ts` (decides tiebreak order when multiple platforms go live in the same tick)

5. Update `.env.example` and `README.md`

6. Create `src/live-check/platforms/{platform}.spec.ts`

### Adding a New Scheduled Task

1. Create a new feature folder `src/{feature-name}/`

2. Create `src/{feature-name}/task.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import { ScheduledTask } from "../scheduling/ScheduledTask.js";

   export default class MyTask extends ScheduledTask {
     public readonly name = "MyTask";
     public readonly schedule = "0 17 * * *";  // 5pm daily
     // Optional: public override readonly jitterMs = 5000;

     public async run(): Promise<void> {
       // Task logic
     }
   }
   ```

3. Register in `src/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   import MyTask from "./{feature-name}/task.js";
   scheduler.register(new MyTask());
   ```

The `Scheduler` handles cron management, prevents overlapping runs (per-task queue), and graceful shutdown.

### Adding a New Briefing Task

Briefing tasks use AI to search the web and send notification summaries. Configs are loaded from `.md` files in the folder specified by `BRIEFINGS_PATH`. To add a new topic, create a markdown file:

```markdown
---
schedule: "0 0 9 * * *"
---
You are a tech news assistant...
```

- **Filename** becomes the config name (e.g. `TechNews.md` → name `"TechNews"`)
- **Frontmatter** must contain a valid `schedule` (node-cron expression)
- **Body** is the prompt sent to the AI agent

The loop in `index.ts` auto-registers all valid configs. Invalid files are skipped with a warning. For custom behavior, subclass `BriefingAgentTask` and override `run()`.

**Prompt Placeholders:** Use placeholders in the prompt body to inject dynamic content at runtime:

- `{{date}}` → current date, e.g. `Thursday, February 6, 2026` (local timezone)
- `{{time}}` → current time, e.g. `9:00 AM EST` (local timezone)
- `{{history:N}}` → last N notifications sent by this briefing (avoids duplicate coverage)

Placeholder resolution lives in `src/briefing-agent/placeholders.ts` which chains all placeholder types via `resolveAllPlaceholders()`.

```markdown
---
schedule: "0 0 9 * * *"
---
You are a tech news assistant. Today is {{date}}, {{time}}.

{{history:10}}

Do not cover topics that appear in past notifications above.
```

History is stored per-briefing in SQLite and auto-pruned to the last 50 entries.

### Error Handling

- Providers catch their own errors and return `LiveStatus.Unknown`
- `LiveCheckTask` tracks consecutive unknowns per channel
- Escalating log levels: debug (1-2) → warn (3-9) → error (10+)
- Logger `warn`/`error` go to Pushover via @micthiesen/mitools

### Task Run Logs

Every log line emitted during a task run is captured and viewable in the web UI (click a task card's last-run line, a history row, or an activity row). How it works:

- `installLogCapture()` (called at boot) sets the global `Logger.onLog` tap from mitools ≥2.4.0. The tap fires for **every** log call regardless of `LOG_LEVEL`, so DEBUG lines reach the UI while console/compose output still respects the threshold.
- `TaskRegistry.execute` wraps `task.run()` in an `AsyncLocalStorage` context carrying the `runId`; the tap attributes lines to the active run (across awaits, sub-loggers, and concurrent tasks). Lines logged outside any run (server, JMAP pipelines) are ignored.
- In-flight lines live in a per-run memory buffer (capped at 2000 lines / 4KB per line, oldest dropped) and are broadcast on `runLogBus`. On run end the buffer is persisted as one `TaskRunLogEntity` row, pruned alongside `TaskRunEntity`'s 50-runs-per-task retention.
- API: `GET /api/task-runs/:runId/logs` (buffer if running, else stored row); `GET /api/task-runs/:runId/logs/stream` (SSE live tail: `init` replays the buffer, `line` frames follow, `done` carries the settled run). Logs never ride the dashboard snapshot stream.
- Frontend: `LogViewer.tsx` modal — level filter chips (debug hidden by default), stick-to-bottom tailing, LIVE badge while streaming.

### Persistence

Uses `@micthiesen/mitools` Entity system with SQLite (`docstore.db`):
- `StreamerStatusEntity`: Aggregate live/offline state per streamer (one row per merged identity, keyed on `streamerId`). Holds the sticky primary binding, summed max viewer count, and the per-binding titles for the current live session.
- `ViewerMetricsEntity`: Daily viewer buckets + all-time max, keyed on `streamerId`. Recorded viewer count is the **sum across currently-live bindings**.

### Streamer Model

A `Streamer` is the identity unit: display name (normalized, case-insensitive) collapses multiple `(platform, username)` bindings into one. Notifications fire on the aggregate edges:
- **went-live**: offline everywhere → live somewhere (one notification)
- **went-offline**: live somewhere → offline everywhere (one notification)
- **title change**: only when the primary binding is unchanged AND its title changed
- **primary switch** (e.g., original primary drops but another is still live): silent

Primary election is **first-to-go-live wins**, sticky for the session. Priority tiebreak when multiple go live simultaneously: YouTube → Twitch → Kick (see `PLATFORM_PRIORITY` in `src/live-check/streamers.ts`).

The pure transition logic lives in `src/live-check/transitions.ts` (`decideTransition`) for easy testing.

### Viewer Metrics System

Tracks viewer records across rolling time windows (7d, 30d, 90d, all-time) using **peak confirmation**:
- Records are only confirmed when viewer count drops 5% below peak (prevents spam during climbs)
- Pending peaks are flushed when stream goes offline
- Only sends one notification for the highest-priority window when multiple records are broken
- Recorded value is the **sum of viewer counts across a streamer's currently-live bindings**, so multistream metrics reflect total reach

## Code Style

- **Biome** for formatting (88 char line width, 2-space indent) and linting
- **2 spaces** for indentation (not tabs)
- **Strong types**: Use enums, discriminated unions, explicit return types
- **No over-engineering**: Simple solutions, no unnecessary abstractions
- **Clean code**: No debug leftovers, no `console.log`, no commented code

## Testing

Uses **vitest** for testing. Run with pnpm:

```bash
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test -- --watch   # Watch mode
```

- YouTube tests are skipped (marked `.skip`) - they need real HTML fixtures
- Twitch tests run against `extractLiveStatus` with mock data
- Test the pure extraction functions, not the network fetchers

### Ad-hoc integration scripts

For testing things that hit real APIs or URLs (e.g. verifying Tavily search, testing HTML-to-markdown on real pages), write a temporary `.ts` script and run it with `dotenvx` + `bun` so it picks up `.env` credentials:

```bash
npx dotenvx run -- bun src/tools/my-test-script.ts
```

Delete the script when done—these are throwaway, not committed.

## Platform-Specific Notes

### YouTube
- Scrapes `/{username}/live` page HTML
- Checks for `ytInitialPlayerResponse` to detect CAPTCHA/consent pages
- Regex matches `"isLive":true` or `"isLiveNow":true`
- Title from `<meta name="title">` tag
- Could break if YouTube changes HTML structure (rare)

### Twitch
- Uses public GQL API: `https://gql.twitch.tv/gql`
- Public client ID: `kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko` (no auth needed)
- Query: `user(login:"xxx"){stream{title viewersCount}}`
- Zod validates response schema
- More stable than YouTube scraping

### Fastmail Integration (JMAP + CalDAV)

Both parcel-tracker and calendar-events share the same JMAP infrastructure (`src/jmap/`):
- **JMAP** (via `jmap-jam`): Email monitoring via SSE event source
- **EmailDispatcher**: Fetches emails once per state change, fans out to registered `EmailHandler`s (parcel-tracker, calendar-events). Owns the shared JMAP state cursor.
- **CalDAV** (raw HTTP): Calendar event creation — `PUT` iCalendar files to Fastmail's CalDAV endpoint
- Auth: `FASTMAIL_API_TOKEN` (bearer token for JMAP), `FASTMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` (basic auth for CalDAV)
- Each pipeline implements `EmailHandler` with a `handleEmails(emails)` method for filtering and processing
- `jmap-jam` only supports email methods; calendar uses raw `fetch()` against `https://caldav.fastmail.com/dav/calendars/`

## Common Tasks

### Debug a channel status
```bash
# Check Twitch manually
curl -s -X POST 'https://gql.twitch.tv/gql' \
  -H 'Client-Id: kimne78kx3ncx6brgo4mv6wki5h1ko' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"query{user(login:\"USERNAME\"){stream{title viewersCount}}}"}'
```

### Reset local state
Delete `docstore.db*` files to clear all channel status/metrics.

## Owner Preferences

- Prefers clean, strongly-typed code
- Likes discriminated unions over boolean flags
- Values robustness (the three-state system was specifically requested)
- Prefers analysis before implementation
- Appreciates GitHub code search for researching approaches
- Wants tests and build to pass before considering work complete
